# Potion of "Get His Ass!"

A mod made for ModFest 1.16. Adds a potion effect ("Hunted") that makes any mobs in standard aggro distance attack the user.

Crafted from an awkward potion with a wither rose, can be extended from 15 seconds to 45 seconds with redstone.

Bosses ignore the hunted effect, but they still attack mobs with it.
